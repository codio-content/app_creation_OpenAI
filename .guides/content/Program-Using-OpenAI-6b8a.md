GPT-3 API is a powerful set of tools for natural language processing that can help developers create innovative applications. Now that we are more or less familiar with GPT-3's API we are going to create our first program using the API. This will serve two goals:
1. It will help to get some practice using Python and the OpenAI API
2. Practice our prompt generation


## Moflix

We are going to create a movie recommendation program powered by OpenAI's GPT-3. The program will be named `Moflix`. Your Python file will be located in the top left , this is where you will put in your code. Lastly, you will be provided with the standard box(located in the bottom left) that we can use as our GPT playground.  

For starters, let's try generating what we want. Use the playground to ask for the following prompt and then run our Try it! button.
`Give me 5 movie recommendations`


{Try it! Playground}(python3 box.py 1)
{Reset ! Playground}(python3 reset.py 1)


## UX 

I know that typing the prompt into our playground is an easy solution, but why don't we take it a step further and create a program specifically designed for movie recommendations? This program will be tailored to give users a smoother movie searching experience, requiring less typing than GPT-3. We'll also focus on UX design to give our users an even better experience. This program will make it easier to find the perfect movie recommendation without having to put in the extra effort on our user.

**UX** stands for User Experience and refers to the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service. It encompasses aspects such as the design, usability, and functionality of an interface, and takes into account the user's needs, motivations, and expectations. A good UX should be enjoyable, intuitive, and provide a positive user experience.
